# 3DOF-leg-Pose-estimation-using-ARUCO-markers

In this project, I recommend a way to estimate the 3D position of a specific point in the model coordinate with respect to another coordinate system using ARUCO markers. The project was run on a 3DOF leg which has a sine motion in the X-axis and we tried to track and measure the tip point of the leg. Here is a demo of the code running on a video shot from the robot.
